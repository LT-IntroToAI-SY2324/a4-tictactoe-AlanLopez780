# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was the game_over and has_won parts, because I didn't even know how to set them up at first. But I was able to understand them more clearly via instructions so I was able to get it done sooner.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would have the computer pick a random position, then pick which position would prevent the player to win.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
The computer player would learn how it can win tic-tac-toe in order to understand how it has to win.
